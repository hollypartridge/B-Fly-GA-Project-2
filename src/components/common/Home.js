II. A Game of Chess<br /><br />
The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, <br />
Glowed on the marble, where the glass<br />
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines<br />
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out<br />
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)<br />
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra<br />
Reflecting light upon the table as<br />
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,<br />
From satin cases poured in rich profusion;<br />
In vials of ivory and coloured glass<br />
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,<br />
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused<br />
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air<br />
That freshened from the window, these ascended<br />
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,<br />
Flung their smoke into the laquearia,<br />
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.<br />
Huge sea-wood fed with copper<br />
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,<br />
In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam.<br />
Above the antique mantel was displayed<br />
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br />
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king<br />
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale<br />
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice<br />
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br />
“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.<br />
And other withered stumps of time<br />
Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br />
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br />
Footsteps shuffled on the stair.<br />
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br />
Spread out in fiery points<br />
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.</p>
